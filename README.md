 Day 3 – Python Practice + Password Checker Project

This folder contains all the Python practice and the final mini-project completed on Day 3 of my learning plan.

What I Learned
              
              Strings (slicing, reversing, vowel check, palindrome)
              
              Sets (unique values, intersections, differences)
              
              File Handling (read, write, append, readlines)
              
              List Comprehensions (filtering, mapping, clean one-liners)


Final Project: Password Strength Analyzer

              A simple command-line tool that checks if a password is strong or weak based on:
              
              Minimum length (8 characters)
              
              One uppercase letter
              
              One lowercase letter
              
              One number
              
              One special character


Project Files

              checker.py          # Main script
              utils.py            # Helper functions
              password_rules.txt  # Rules loaded from file
              log.txt             # Stores password check history

How to Run
python checker.py
Enter a password when asked.

The program will:
                Evaluate the password
                Show if it is Strong or Weak
                Save the result in log.txt
                Display all rules
